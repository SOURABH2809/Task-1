# E-Commerce Page Built with JavaScript
This project demonstrates the creation of a simple e-commerce page using JavaScript only, without the use of any external CSS libraries. The entire structure and design of the page, including the HTML and CSS, are dynamically generated using JavaScript. The page includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing products. The data is fetched from a db.json file using the fetch method.

2. **Pagination:** Products are displayed in pages for easier navigation.
3. **Delete Products:** Users can remove products from the list.
4. **Add New Product:** Users can add new products to the store.
5. **Update Product:** Users can modify product details.
6. **Dynamic HTML and CSS:** The entire page structure and styling are created using JavaScript, without any predefined HTML or external CSS.
7. **Data Storage:** Product data is stored in a db.json file and accessed via the fetch method.
8. **CRUD Operations:**
- **Create:** Users can add new products through a form.
- **Read:** The product list is fetched from db.json and displayed dynamically.
- **Update:** Existing product details can be edited.
- **Delete:** Products can be removed from the list.
